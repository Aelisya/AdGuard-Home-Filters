# AdGuard-Home-Filters
Many list with ABP Syntax for AdGuard Home DNS blocking. I host users scripts in Public Domain here only because i want to control them since users scripts are dangerous if not checked seriously.

## Why hosting some script who are in other place ?
To this question there is two and distrinct answers
- First for the adblock list some of them are modified by me or converted to ABP syntax for optimization.
- For the userscript since it inject JS in AdGuard Windows to inject in my browser i prefer to controll them totally and manually apply update.
