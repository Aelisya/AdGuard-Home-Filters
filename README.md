# AdGuard-Home-Filters
Many list with ABP Syntax for AdGuard Home DNS blocking.

## AND what list do you use ?
This is the filter list i use :
- [Aelisya's Protection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macqael/AdGuard-Home-Filters/main/AdGuard-Home/Aelisya's-Protect-Basic.abp) (From this repo)
- [OISD](https://abp.oisd.nl/)

## And the whitelist file ?
Basic One on the repo or microsoft plus (unlock all microsoft domain).

## Ok and the upstream DNS ?
For that i use Quad9 on DNSCRYPT :

    sdns://AQMAAAAAAAAAFFsyNjIwOmZlOjpmZTo5XTo4NDQzIGfIR7jIdYzRICRVQ751Z0bfNN8dhMALjEcDaN-CHYY-GTIuZG5zY3J5cHQtY2VydC5xdWFkOS5uZXQ

    sdns://AQMAAAAAAAAADDkuOS45Ljk6ODQ0MyBnyEe4yHWM0SAkVUO-dWdG3zTfHYTAC4xHA2jfgh2GPhkyLmRuc2NyeXB0LWNlcnQucXVhZDkubmV0

## And for the protocol ?
I use DNSCRYPT because he protect more than DoH DoT or DoQ.

## For the DNS priming servers ?
i don't really need it (since DNSCRYPT have in it's stamps the ip of the server but i config the localhost)
Quad9 : 127.0.0.1

## And for the connection between the client and AdGuard ?
I use Dns Over Https because iPhone/Mac Os Bigsur have DOH support and Windows 10 Will have it too soon, and since i control the server (physically and software) i don't have to worry about cookies and history log or dns spoofing.
